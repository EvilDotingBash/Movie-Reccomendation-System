# 🎬 Movie Recommender System Using Machine Learning

## 📌 Introduction

In today's fast-paced world, recommendation systems have become essential. With so many choices available, people need a way to find the best content without spending too much time searching. 

A recommendation system helps users discover content that matches their interests. It analyzes various factors like browsing history, preferences, and similar users' behavior to suggest the most relevant options. These systems use AI-based algorithms to provide personalized recommendations, making it easier for users to find what they love.

## 🔍 Types of Recommendation Systems

### 1️⃣ Content-Based Filtering
- Uses item attributes and user preferences.
- Examples: Twitter, YouTube.
- Recommends content based on what a user has previously liked.
- Forms embeddings for features like music preferences, genres, and actors.
- **Challenge**: It may limit recommendations to only what the user has seen before, missing out on new content.

### 2️⃣ Collaborative Filtering
- Based on user-item interactions.
- Finds users with similar interests and suggests content they liked.
- Example: Book recommendation systems.
- Works by analyzing ratings and user preferences.
- **Challenges**:
  - Requires a large dataset to be effective.
  - New items may not get recommended immediately.

### 3️⃣ Hybrid Recommendation System
- Combines content-based and collaborative filtering for better results.
- Avoids the limitations of using just one method.
- Uses advanced techniques like **word2vec** and **embedding models**.
- Most modern recommendation systems use this approach.

## 📌 About This Project

This is a **Streamlit web application** that recommends movies based on user preferences. It uses a precomputed similarity model to suggest similar movies.

### 🔹 **How It Works: Cosine Similarity**

1. **Cosine Similarity** measures how similar two items are.
2. Converts text data into numerical vectors.
3. Produces a similarity score between **0 and 1**:
   - **0** → Completely different.
   - **1** → Identical.
4. More details: [Cosine Similarity Guide](https://www.learndatasci.com/glossary/cosine-similarity/).
